          0ratorio Virtuale is an electroacoustic audio-visual rework 
          of the baroque oratorio "San Giovanni Battista" (1675, Alessandro Stradella). 
          Commissioned by the <a href="https://www.eutopiaensemble.net/" target="_blank">Eutopia Ensemble</a> and 
          <a href="http://forevergreen.fm/wp/" target="_blank">Forevergreen.fm</a> 
          the opera was presented for <a href="https://www.electropark.it/" target="_blank">Electropark 2019</a>, 
          Le Strade del Suono and Le vie del Barocco (October 16th 2019 @Villa del Principe, Genova - IT).

                The original oratorio tells the  story of the tragic death of John the Baptist, 
                who tries to convince Herode to end the relationship with his brother's wife. 
                The latter and her daughter, Salome, not willing to give up their sumptuous life, 
                they convince Herode to imprison the Baptist. The epilogue is tragic: when Herode, 
                after the sensual dance of Salome, offers her whatever she desires, Salome asks for the head of the prophet.

              In my rework, the original oratorio acquires an allegorical meaning. 

               John the Baptist is depersonalized, embracing rather the pre-Christian symbolism that accompanies him. 
               A wild man who lives in the desert, 
               he symbolises the darkness from whose experience it is possible to approach the light: 
               the <i>solis statio</i> (arrest of the Sun).

              <div class="normal_text">          
                    The Baptist is celebrated on the summer solstice day, linking him to the pagan cults of the Sun.
    
                   "The door of men", from which a renewed light flows: 
                   the ecstatic union of the opposites. Sun-Moon, Fire-Water, Light-Shadow, Man-Woman, 
                   Positive-Negative, Good-Evil, Soul-Body, Love-Hate.

               Fragments of the Symphony and some Arias of the original oratorio are exploited, 
               both through the sampling and processing of audio recordings, 
               and by reworking the musical materials (melodies, harmony, rhythms) composed by Stradella.

                The audio fragments are combined to create a 3D visual space, which supports the sound metamorphosis of the ancient materials.

                The result is a pulsating audio-visual work, with rich electroacoustic textures, which alternate 
                rarefied acoustic moments with dramatic noise/IDM blasts, weaving a network of unexpected relations with the original work and 
               searching for the fulcrum of the John the Baptist's symbolism.
